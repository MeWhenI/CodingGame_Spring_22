# Attacker

don't move randomly, formalize the jungler movement method and implement it for attacker
mess with range, he spends too much time doing nothing / not going for monsters that are slightly too far
look at how the pros use control, im too conservative with it
 the "monster is close to base" cond for control is probably too limiting / totally unneccesary
offensive shield use?
 
 # Defenders
 
 i get dunked on by control attackers
 shield (on monsters) attackers are also rough?
 more effective decisions on who goes for what target
 its really bad when the two switch targets (monsters crossing the direction change border might affect this)
 develop more under_attack procedures
 move out of control range (or wind them out of range from controlling me)? or else just keep eachother in shield-cast range
 learn attacker's control pattern? if they aren't spamming control every frame my guys can shield themselves
 
 
 # Misc
 
 method for cmp sqrdist so im not using "magic number" esque squaring
